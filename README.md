# Coding quiz
This quiz is a multiple-choice question quiz that consists of four coding-related questions. When the user starts the quiz, the 60-second timer starts counting down. When a question is answered correctly, the user gets a message informing them that their answer is correct. When the answer is incorrect, the user is notifed that their answer is incorrect, and 10 seconds are subtracted from the timer. 
When all of the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the quiz is over. When the quiz is over, the user gets their score (which equals the number of seconds remaining), and then the user is asked to enter their initials.
At the end, the user can save their score to look at it later.
The user has the option to delete their previously saved scores from the scoreboard.
